<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

```sh
gh repo clone soham-aggarwal/CustomTableSpresso
Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## The idea behind the example

This example demonstrates how you can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## What's next?

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation, continuing browsing it from the [templates](https://mui.com/getting-started/templates/) section.
